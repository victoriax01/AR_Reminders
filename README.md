# AR_Reminders
This is the chosen prototype for the final implementation for my dissertation. This application allows users to place reminders in Augmented Reality around the room they are currently in. The reminders are chosen from a carousel of icons and the user can then choose to add text or colours to the reminder. More reminder types can be easily added to the carousel. The specific domain that this application has been researched for is in Nursing.
